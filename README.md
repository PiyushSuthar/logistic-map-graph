> I'll recommend watching or reading about this before using it :p. You'll get some context what the hell it is XD.

Got inspiration to make this from this video:-
[This equation will change how you see the world (the logistic map)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk) by [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA)

Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) to know more about this.

# Logistic Map Graph

Logistic Map is a one-dimensional discrete-time map that, despite its formal simplicity, exhibits an unexpected degree of complexity. Historically it has been one of the most important and paradigmatic systems during the early days of research on deterministic chaos. Logistic Map was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation written down by Pierre François Verhulst.

Mathematically, the logistic map is written as:

Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) to know more about this.

> I'll recommend watching or reading about this before using it :p. You'll get some context what the hell it is XD.

## Inspiration

Got inspiration to make this from this video:-
[This equation will change how you see the world (the logistic map)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk) by [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA)

I was quite fascinated about the equation and graph shown in that video.

## Contribution

This project isn't perfect at all. I did it for fun! If you think something can be improved then please give a PR or probably create an Issue!
